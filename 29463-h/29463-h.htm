HIS HAND, (PROBABLY A CLASSIC AUTHOR,) BETWEEN WHICH, AND HIS PUPILS,
AND THE SCENERY, HE DIVIDED HIS ATTENTION IN ABOUT EQUAL PARTS. THERE
WAS A SPECIMEN OF THE ENGLISH GRUMBLER, BIG, BURLY, AND AS IF IN DANGER
OF CHOKING FROM THE TIGHTNESS OF HIS CRAVAT. EVERY ONE KNOWS HIM, HIS
PLEASANT WAYS, AND HIS CONSTANT FLOW OF GOOD HUMOUR AND CHEERFULNESS;
THAT IS HE, SITTING TO THE RIGHT. THERE WERE BESIDES, NUMEROUS YOUNG
GENTLEMEN FROM THE UNIVERSITIES, FROM THE ARMY, FROM THE BAR, ALL WITH
MORE OR LESS HAIR ON THEIR UPPER LIPS; AND THERE WAS A CAVALRY OFFICER
OF THE RUSSIAN GUARD, AND A PROFESSOR, ON HIS WAY TO HEIDELBERG, AND
LOOSE, DISHEVELLED, HAIRY, SMOKY YOUNG GERMANS, WITH LONG BEARDS, AND
LONGER PIPES. AND THERE WAS A BRITISH NOBLEMAN, AND A BRITISH ALDERMAN,
AND A BRITISH ALDERWOMAN; AND THERE WERE BRITISH LADIES WHOM I CAN’T
DESCRIBE, BECAUSE THEY WORE THOSE “UGLY” THINGS WHICH PREVENT THEM BEING
SEEN; INTELLIGENT YOUNG AMERICANS ON THEIR WAY ALL OVER THE WORLD; NUNS,
WITH THEIR QUIET, HAPPY FACES; RED REPUBLICANS FROM FRANKFORT, AND SNOBS
FROM LONDON.</p>

Brown, Jones, and Robinson have arrived at &mdash;&mdash;, the capital

be giving it an undue distinction, and might offend the others).</p>

<p class = "plain">
They have been received with distinguished consideration, the “local”
paper having announced their arrival as Count Robinson, Sir Brown, and
the Rev. Jones. They have been invited to be present at a grand review,
and Robinson&mdash;who amongst other necessaries in those portmanteaus
of his, carried a uniform as Captain of Yeomanry&mdash;thought that this
was just the proper occasion to appear in it. Accordingly, he rode on to
the ground upon a charger (hired), in the character of a warrior, with a
solemnity of countenance befitting the scene and his country, and
accompanied by Jones (also mounted), but in the costume of an ordinary
individual of the period. Brown preferred going on foot. That is
Robinson in the centre. Just at the time when he ought to be riding up
the line, inspecting the troops with the Grand Duke and his
staff&mdash;his horse (a “disgusting brute,” as Robinson afterwards
described him, “who could not have been in the habit of carrying
gentlemen”) suddenly stood on his hind legs, in the very middle of the
field, so that his rider was forced to cling on to him in an absurd
manner, in full view of the army, the people, and the court.</p>

THE ENTERTAINMENT COMMENCED AT 5 P.M., AND LASTED TILL 7. IT CONSISTED
OF A MELODRAMA, FULL OF AWFUL CRIMES, AND THE MOST PATHETIC SENTIMENT.
THE AUDIENCE, CHIEFLY COMPOSED OF “THE PEOPLE,” WAS, FROM BEGINNING TO
END, IN AN EXTRAORDINARY STATE OF EXCITEMENT, FIZZING, LIKE THE
PERPETUAL GOING OFF OF SODA-WATER. THE THEATRE WAS LIGHTED (?) BY ABOUT
FOUR OIL LAMPS; AND SUCH WAS THE DARKNESS, THAT OUR TRAVELLERS&mdash;WHO
MAY BE SEEN, PERHAPS, THROUGH THE “DIM OBSCURE,” UP IN A PRIVATE
BOX&mdash;COULD SCARCELY DISCERN ANYTHING BUT THE WHITE UNIFORM AND
GLITTERING BAYONET OF AN AUSTRIAN SENTINEL IN THE PIT.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
